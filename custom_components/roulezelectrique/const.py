# 30s (was 60s): this poll is the ONLY thing that ever picks up a change made
# OUTSIDE Home Assistant (e.g. from the Roulez Électrique mobile app) — HA's
# own writes already self-refresh instantly via async_request_refresh() (see
# number.py/switch.py), so only the app→HA direction was ever waiting on this
# timer. Halving it halves worst-case latency for that direction. Safe to
# lower: MIN_SCAN_INTERVAL already permits 30, the server's
# /home-assistant/state read is cheap/cached, and any install with its own
# saved `scan_interval` option is unaffected (this is only the fallback for
# entries that never customized it).

# The EVduty/Elmec MaxCurrent recipe (ChangeConfiguration -> read-back ->
# Reset) runs SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the server's single HTTP request, with a
# per-step budget of ~12s x 3 steps. The default 20s client timeout would
# abort a perfectly healthy call mid-recipe, so this endpoint gets its own,
# wider budget. Kept under the server-side ceiling it is bounded by
# (php max_execution_time 60s / nginx fastcgi_read_timeout 120s).

# IYILO-only settings (server calls this vendor "ave" on the wire — see

# outcome, never a command id to poll. Gated server-side on the
# per-charger `plug_and_charge`/`time_zone`/`reboot` capability strings.
