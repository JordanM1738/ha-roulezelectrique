"""Button platform for the Roulez Électrique integration.

Two button types:
  - Refresh: one per charger device (every vendor). Pressing it calls
    `coordinator.async_request_refresh()` — the exact same call every write
    action (switch.py, number.py) already triggers on success — forcing an
    immediate re-poll of the server's cached state. A local, no-side-effect
    action: it never calls a vendor API and cannot itself fail.
  - Reboot: IYILO ONLY (server capability "reboot"; IYILO is the vendor this
    repo calls "ave" on the wire). Pressing it calls
    POST /chargers/{id}/ave/reboot and DOES power-cycle the physical borne —
    unlike Refresh, this has a real, disruptive side effect and interrupts
    any charging session in progress. See the class docstring below for why
    that matters here specifically (HA gives buttons no confirmation step).

Why Refresh exists: HA's own writes (start/stop, lock, set current) already
self-refresh instantly, so HA→app changes are never stale. But a change made
OUTSIDE Home Assistant (e.g. from the Roulez Électrique mobile app) is only
ever picked up by HA's periodic poll (`DEFAULT_SCAN_INTERVAL` /
the `scan_interval` option, see const.py), up to that many seconds later.
Re-opening the HA companion app does NOT force a poll — it only re-reads HA
Core's already-cached state — so there was previously no way for a user to
force an immediate re-check from the app. Refresh is that action.

`async_request_refresh()` only re-reads the server's already-cached state (see
coordinator.py's module docstring) — it never calls a vendor API and cannot
itself fail in a way that needs a fail-closed HomeAssistantError, unlike the
switch/number write paths, and unlike Reboot below.
